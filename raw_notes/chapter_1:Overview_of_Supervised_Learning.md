# 1: Overview of Supervised Learning
This Chapter will provide a brief introduction to various supervised learning methods that are later explained in detail in later chapters

### Least Square (linear) vs Nearest Neighbors

| Model             | Assumption | Stability       | accuracy            |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Linear            | Heavy      | stable          | possibly inaccurate |
| Nearest Neighbors | very mild  | can be unstable | often accurate      |



#### Linear Models and Least Squares

Given a vector of inputs $X^T = (X_1,X_2,...,X_p)$
